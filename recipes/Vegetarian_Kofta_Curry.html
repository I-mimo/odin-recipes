    <h3>Vegetarian Kofta Curry</h3>
    <p
      >My mother-in-law is Indian and let me in on a secret: The vegetable balls
      from IKEA® make for a great and ridiculously easy vegetarian kofta curry.
      This is ready in just about 30 minutes, making it perfect for a weeknight.
      Serve with basmati rice.</p

        >Heat olive oil and butter in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add

        Cook until spices start to sputter, about 1 minute. Stir in onion,

        Stir in diced tomatoes, coriander, turmeric, cumin, garam masala,
        cayenne, and salt. Bring mixture to a gentle simmer; add yogurt and stir
        well. Add frozen vegetable balls. Pour in hot water to thin sauce
        slightly to desired consistency. Bring mixture back to a simmer and
        cook, covered, until sauce is thickened and vegetable balls are heated
        through, 10 to 15 minutes.
